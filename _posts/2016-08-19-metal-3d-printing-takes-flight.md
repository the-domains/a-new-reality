  While many designers and engineers find success with 3D-printing parts in
  plastic for prototyping and low-volume production, producing parts out of
  metal using similar technology has recently led to the creation of some of the
  most exciting 3D-printed parts in memory. With key patents for metal printing
  expiring at the end of 2016, things are looking particularly exciting.
